# Dementia-Prediction-Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of dementia based on the Dementia prediction dataset.

## Overview

The Dementia prediction dataset contains features such as age, gender, education level, and cognitive test scores. Using this dataset, we have created a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of dementia in an individual.

The model is built using Python and scikit-learn library, and the code for the model is included in the dementia_prediction.ipynb notebook. The repository also contains the dementia.csv file, which is the dataset used to train and test the model.

## How to Use

To use the model, you will need to download the repository and open the dementia_prediction.ipynb notebook. The notebook includes step-by-step instructions for loading and preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed, including scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas.

## Disclaimer

The model is intended for research purposes only and should not be used as a diagnostic tool. It is important to note that the accuracy of the model may vary depending on the dataset and the specific features used for prediction.
